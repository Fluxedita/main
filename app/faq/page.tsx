        question: 'Who is Fluxedita for?',

      {
        question: 'Are all Fluxedita packages scalable?',
        answer: 'Yes ‚Äî every Fluxedita package is fully scalable.Whether you start with a Landing Page or go straight to Premium, you are never locked into a rigid structure.\nYou can add unlimited pages, users, and features as your project grows.\nIn fact, all of our packages include the same underlying architecture and database schema used in our Premium build ‚Äî so if you have the development skills, you can scale and customize as far as you want.\nWe do not limit your potential ‚Äî we give you a launchpad.\nIf you are comfortable working with modern tools, you are free to build, extend, and evolve your site without restriction.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I start with a smaller package and upgrade later?',
        answer: 'Absolutely. Each package is designed to grow with you. Start simple, and upgrade at any time ‚Äî whether you\'re adding features, pages, or transitioning to a full content platform.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What\'s included across all packages?',
        answer: 'Every package includes: The same project architecture, the full database schema used in the Premium version, full live-editing features, and cloud-connected services like Supabase, Stripe (ready), and Cloudinary. This means you have access to the same robust foundation, no matter where you start.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I add more pages to a Landing, Standard, or Advanced package?',
        answer: 'Yes ‚Äî without restriction. While our packages offer different starting points, there are no limitations on how many additional pages you can create or how you customize them. In fact, even the Landing Page package can evolve into a full-blown platform ‚Äî it\'s entirely up to you and your development goals.'
      },
      {
        question: 'What makes the Premium package different?',
        answer: 'The Premium package comes with pre-built media-rich root page sets (/gallery, /exclusive, /behind-the-scenes), built-in media set generation, lightbox views, and commenting system, and auto-generated pages per media upload. That said, you can manually build similar features in any package if you have development knowledge ‚Äî the architecture supports it across the board.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I turn a Landing Page package into a Premium-style setup myself?',
        answer: 'Yes. Because all packages share the same scalable architecture and schema, a developer can build up from any starting point. You\'re never boxed in.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Are Fluxedita packages stable and production-ready?',
        answer: `Fluxedita packages are currently in their Beta/V1 release phase, which essentially means, all are functional but one (or two) sections may contain minor bugs periodically as they are being updated. These issues do not affect core application functionality, and our development team is actively addressing them based on priority. This is reflected in our opening offer prices.

Some section components are still in Beta mode and will be updated over time. These components are provided gratis‚Äîthey're optional and primarily serve as examples to help you understand how to construct your own sections. Though all sections are functional, some are special, some are fantastic; all are unique to Fluxedita and there will be more fantastic sections added to the Fluxedita packages over the next coming months. For full flexibility, we recommend exploring our Custom Code Component, which allows you to integrate your own designs seamlessly.

All packages include a minimum of 12 months of updates, ensuring that bugs are resolved and new features and components are added regularly. This ongoing support is reflected in our first-tier pricing.

When you consider what's included in each package, the value is exceptional. For example, the Landing Page Package alone represents hundreds of hours of development and can be installed and running in under an hour‚Äîfor just ¬£99. With built-in editability and customization, a single purchase gives you unlimited potential for unique, prebuilt web packages‚Äîno two need ever be the same.`

      },
      {
        question: 'Do I need to be a developer to use Fluxedita?',

      },
      {
        question: 'Can I host Fluxedita myself?',
        answer: 'Yes. All packages are self-hostable. You control where and how your website is deployed ‚Äî whether on Vercel, Netlify, or your own infrastructure.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Can I use other hosting providers, other than Vercel?',
        answer: 'Yes, you can use any hosting provider that supports Next.js. Here\'s a comparison of popular hosting options:\nHosting Provider | Support Level | Key Features |\nVercel | ‚≠êÔ∏è Native support | Built by the creators of Next.js; supports SSR, ISR, App Router, serverless functions, and edge caching |\nNetlify | ‚úÖ Full support | Supports App Router, ISR, SSR, image optimization, and middleware via OpenNext adapter |\nCloudways | ‚úÖ Supported | Allows deployment via Git, supports PM2, Nginx, and Node.js environments |\nA2 Hosting | ‚úÖ Supported (manual setup) | Node.js-compatible servers, cPanel integration, and guides for deploying Next.js apps |\nHostinger | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited (shared hosting) / ‚úÖ Full (VPS) | Shared hosting only supports static exports; VPS supports full Node.js apps |\n\nYou can deploy Fluxedita to any of these providers (+ many other providers available, this is not an exhaustive list), though the setup process may vary.

      },
      {
        question: 'What services do I need to connect?',
        answer: 'You\ will need accounts with: a remote Database provider, such as Supabase, for user auth and database, though you can use any database service you wish (Convex, Firebase, etc); Cloudinary (for media storage and delivery, once again this is optional); and Stripe (if you want to accept payments or create membership options, once again this is optional). Our suggested integrations are pre-configured ‚Äî just plug in your API keys.
